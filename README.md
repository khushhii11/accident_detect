# Accident Detection System

## Motivation
Road accidents are a major cause of injuries and fatalities worldwide. This project was built to explore how AI can assist in real-time accident detection using video feeds, providing early alerts for emergency intervention.

---

## Features
- Real-time accident detection from dashcam videos or image frames.
- Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for pattern recognition.
- Supports batch processing of video datasets.
- Provides accuracy metrics for model evaluation.

## 1. Demonstration

## 2. What is Accident Detection System?

An accident Detection System is designed to detect accidents via video or CCTV footage. Road accidents are a significant problem for the whole world. Many people lose their lives in road accidents. We can minimize this issue by using CCTV accident detection. This repository majorly explores how CCTV can detect these accidents with the help of Deep Learning.

## 3. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
## 4. Getting Started - How to use it?

### Clone this repository

`https://github.com/krishrustagi/Accident-Detection-System.git`

To install all the packages required to run this python program
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Note:** This project requires a camera. So make sure you have a connected camera to your device. You can also use a downloaded video if not using a camera.

### Run
Before running the program, you need to run the `accident-classification.ipynb` file which will create the `model_weights.h5` file. Then, to run this python program, you need to execute the `main.py` python file.

## 5. Description

This program includes 4 things.

1. `data`: Kaggle dataset on [Accident Detection from CCTV footage](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mrcruise/accident-classification/data).
2. `accident-classification.ipynb`: This is a jupyter notebook that generates a model to classify the above data. This file generates two important files `model.json` and `model_weights.h5`.
3. `detection.py`: This file loads the Accident Detection system with the help of `model.json` and `model_weights.h5` files.
4. `camera.py`: It packs the camera and executes the `detection.py` file on the video dividing it frame by frame and displaying the percentage of the prediction in the accident (if present) in the frame.

## 6. Future Work

We can use an alarm system that can call the nearest police station in case of an accident and also alert them of the severity of the accident.
